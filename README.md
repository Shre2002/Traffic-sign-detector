# Traffic-sign-detector
A traffic and road sign detector using AI for autonomous vehicles
Road sign recognition is one of the important tasks of intelligent transportation
systems (ITS). The project aims at implementation of road sign detection and
control of an autonomous vehicle using Haar Cascade Classifier algorithm. In this
proposed work, the system automatically detects the road signs, controls the
vehicle and command certain actions.
